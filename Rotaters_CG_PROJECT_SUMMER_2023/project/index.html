    <p>a, d for view that was recommended</p>
    <p>q, e for view that is rotatin up down</p>
    <p>z, c view just rotates around orbit</p>
    <p>p for perspective, o for orthogonal view</p>
    <p>Left, Right, Up, Down arrows to move camera</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> as a group we know how to have different colors</p>
    <p>We need to have individual shaders for each sphere. then we will apply the lightining to these shaders.</p>
    <p>We would have different material properties for each planet and send them to their own shaders. So no need to change lights values. 
        Just changing materials were enough.</p>
    <p>We got these points to get nice colors and lights on planets. So many times we tried this but shaders always had bugs and errors</p>
    <p>As a team we tried to have look at sphereTest and GeometryTest files, but website were down and in github only geometryTest were avaliable</p>
    <p>As a result coloring is not able, but we know how to do it. Due to limited time, we must submit it like this.</p>
    <p>As an example there is additions in code that we tried to have materials for them</p>
    <p>In vertex-shader1 "fColor = vColor + ambient + diffuse + specular;" just change ambient to ambientP or ambientP2 or ambientP3 to see that what was our strategy</p>
